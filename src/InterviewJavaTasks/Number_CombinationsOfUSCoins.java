/*
    return the number of different combinations of US coins
    (penny: 1c, nickel: 5c, dime: 10c, quarter: 25c, half-dollar: 50c)
    which may be used to produce a given amount of money.
    For example, 11 cents can be produced with:
        one 10-cent coin and one 1-cent coin,
        two 5-cent coins and one 1-cent coin,
        one 5-cent coin and six 1-cent coins,
        or eleven 1 cent coins.
    So there are four unique ways to produce 11 cents, therefore output should be 4
    Assume that the cents parameter is always positive.
