Hello today im gonna talk about SDLC

so SDLC stands for Software Development Life CYcle

sdlc has 6 steps

so first one is requirement gathering

its when the business team which include PM project manager, PO project owner and BA business Analyst getting detailed 
requiremnt from client or stake holder.
so the output of this step is several documents, its market requirment, functional requirment and the more important 
is Software Requirment Document or SRS

step 2 is Designing

Designers getting all requirments and they createing kind of blue print of the app
and output of this step is SDS stands from Software Design Specification and app model

step 3 its developing or coding

so from this step, our app start actualy developing 
developer writing code according SRS and SDS documents

step 4  its Testing
testers perform software testing based on functional and non functional requirments and if they find any bug in the 
app they are return back to developers and they are fixing this bug
and output if this step is bug free software and ready to be releasd app

step 5 is releasing

on this step our app launching to the market

and the last step is maintaing
 
on this step if our end users find some bugs developers trying to fix them
and also if the client decide improve the software or want to add some new features our Software Development Cycle is launched again.
in other words all the team members will start from the requirment gathering step again to develop the new features

that is why software development is a cycle
